## Overview
Budget calculator for sales planning in an online game.
The application is live at http://lavneet.gitlab.io/Mued/

## Background
This was my first publicly released web app which was developed during school years, while being part of the gaming community at [Tanki Online](http://tankionline.com/).
Being fairly inexperienced at that point, I designed the application to be exclusively static with no regard for dedicated database and minimal code organization.
I never had to chance to improve this further since it became obsolete soon after the release - when the game integrated key features into their wiki platform. Nonetheless, I have great regard for this project since it was very well-received, and thus established my footing into the exciting world of software development.
